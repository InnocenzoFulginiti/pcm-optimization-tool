# Optimization Framework for Reducing Mid-circuit Measurements and Resets

This tool implements the method for reducing the number of mid-circuit measurements and resets in dynamic circuits proposet in the paper [Reducing Mid-Circuit Measurements via Probabilistic Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13747) and extended in the paper [Optimization Framework for Reducing Mid-circuit Measurements and Resets]().

## Quantum Constant Propagation
This project is based on an existing Quantum Constant Propagation (QCP) implementation and extends it by adding support for the Probabilistic Circuit Model, with the main goal of reducing the number of mid-circuit measurements and resets at compile time.

The QCP implementation is based  on the thesis [Efficient Implementation of Constant Propagation for Quantum Circuits](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/fileadmin/w00cfj/pl/_my_direct_uploads/Efficient_Implementation_of_Constant_Propagation_for_Quantum_Circuits.pdf) whose implementation can be found in the repository: https://gitlab.lrz.de/theses/master-thesis-jakob-wt22.
